This is the group project, a report on the pollution in Occitanie through two data sets, which are :

* The meteorological prediction  (data **SYNOP**)
* The pollution in Occitanie (data **Atmo Occitanie**)

Objective : create an interactive website giving the pollution of the previous month, the past year and the last five years, for different polluting substances and in a few cities in France.

## Summary of the conditions :  

* At least one page of the website must contain an interactive element (maps, widget, etc.)  

* The code must be placed in a repository /HAX712X

* Make a slideshow (with Quarto) to use during the oral presentation of the project 

* Create a file .gitignore to avoid adding unecessary files 

* Here is the link to the website page : https://romeobex.github.io/Projet_Groupe_Pollution_Air_Occitanie/ 

* A code extract for the website 

* An authors list

* Code at least one class with Python 

* The project must contain submodules

* At least two branches must be used during the project


## Packages/Software description for the project :

**Numpy** : NumPy is very useful for mathematical calculations involving arrays and matrixes. Thanks to this package operations are far more quick and efficient than with Python lists.

**os** : With the os module, operations can be made independently of the operaing system, which simplifies group work, as people can more easily work from different operating systems.  

**pandas** : library specialised in data manipulation and analysis 
The name « Pandas » is a contraction of the term « Panel Data », referring to the datasets including observations during multiple periods. This library was created as an advanced tool for Python analysis.

**Matplotlib** : Matplotlib is a Python library intended for graph representation of data. It can be combined with NumPy and other pyhton libraries.
